"""
Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.

Prototype: def safe_print_division(a, b):
You can assume that a and b are integers
The result of the division should print on the finally: section preceded by Inside result:
Returns the value of the division, otherwise: None
You have to use try: / except: / finally:
You have to use "{}".format() to print the result
You are not allowed to import any module
